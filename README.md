# **Blood Pressure and Alcohol Consumption Clustering & Classification**

This project was created to complete a Dicoding assignment, aiming to enhance understanding of data analysis through clustering and classification techniques. The main objectives of this project are:
  - Clustering the data to explore the relationship between blood pressure and alcohol consumption using clustering algorithms.
  - Predicting the resulting clusters using various classification models.
The project involves data exploration, applying machine learning methods for clustering, and building classification models with performance evaluation to predict the generated clusters.

**Goals**
  - Analyze patterns and relationships between blood pressure and alcohol consumption.
  - Identify data groups with similar characteristics using clustering methods.
  - Develop classification models to predict clusters based on input data.
